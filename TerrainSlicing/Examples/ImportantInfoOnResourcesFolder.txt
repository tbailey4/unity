The Terrain Prefabs in the Resources folder will be included when you build your project, 
even if you are not using them.

To keep this from happening, you can delete the folder or rename it to something 
else (like ResourcesBackup).

If you rename the folder, however, keep in mind that the BasicDynamicLoadingSetup 
and EndlessRecenteringWorld example scenes will not work.
