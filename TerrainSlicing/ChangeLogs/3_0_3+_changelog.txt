3.0.4 Changelog
1)	Fixed a bug that caused Terrains to not be neighbored correctly when using an endless world, world recentering, and the 
	World.ChangeGroupName method.

2)	Fixed a bug with Terrain Slicing Tool which caused 'Disable Alphamap Blending' option to not do anything, and also caused the blending
	width to always be 1 when using alphamap blending.

3)	Added Example Scenes showing a standard setup and a setup using an endless recentering world. More examples will be added in the future.

3.0.3 Changelog

1)  Layer Hiding is now discouraged when using scene loading. If your scenes are not fixed/static, you should now do the following (note, 
	this applies to manual scene setup only; the Scene Generation tool automatically does this for you if "Are Scenes Fixed" is disabled):
		A)	Create a new empty game object to serve as your root cell object. Set its tag to the unbound object tag, and give it the correct name
			(should be the same as your scene, something like "Slice_1_1"). Set it's layer to whatever you want ("hidden" layer is no longer used).
			It's imperative that this root object be in an activated state.

			You should also change this new root object's position to the position of the previous root object.

			Note that the root object can have components, and indeed, if using Cell Actions, they must be added to the root object. However,
			there should be no components which render anything!

		B)	Create a "deactivated node." A deactivated node is simply a game object who's state (in the inspector) is disabled. Parent this
			game object to the root object created in Step a. Note that you can choose to make your Terrain/Mesh/Other main object your 
			deactivated node, but you don't have to.

		C)	Parent all other objects in your scene to the deactivated node. They will be deactivated in the hiearchy, but will retain their 
			activeSelf state. Once the root object has been positioned correctly by the scene loader component, it will activate the 
			deactivated node, which will in turn activate any objects which have their activSelf 
			state set to true.

			Ensure the terrain/mesh/other main object, which was probably previously the root object in your scene, is positioned correctly.
			If you set the new root object created in step A to the position of the previous root object, the terrain/mesh/object should have 
			its position set to 0. If it doesn't, this may (but does not necessarily) indicate that your root object was not positioned 
			correctly.

	This change should result in significant performance gains when using Scene Loading.

2)	Modified Scene Generation Tool. Some options removed, and "Are Scenes Fixed" option added. The tool will now create the hierarchy
	described above when 'Are Scenes Fixed' is disabled. If this option is enabled, each scene will simply contain each prefab as is.

3)	Removed option to deactivate the prefabs created using the Slicing Tool, since deactivation of prefabs when using the Prefab Instantiator
	is no longer necessary.

4)	Fixed NullReferenceException errors that would occur when trying to tile the outer edges of a terrain group using the TileableTerrainMaker
	tool, when the terrain group has a missing terrain in the inner section.

5)	Chapter 4, Section 3 of Dynamic Loading Kit_Full_Guide has been rewritten, and some other sections have been slightly updated. 
	Also added the version of kit to top of guide, so users can identify which version they're using for when trying to receive support.
