Special note about disabling Worlds and Active Grids.

Only Worlds and Active Grids that will be used as prototypes (via the Component Manager) 
should be disabled.

If you need a World or Active Grid, but don't plan on using it immediately, either leave it enabled or create a prototype 
for that World or Active Grid and then create the component via the Component Manager when it is required.

While this goes against the usual way of doing things in Unity (usually you just disable the game object/component 
and when it is needed, enable it), it is unfortunately necessary in order to gain some of the benefits of the kit, mainly 
the automatic saving of persistent data for all components in the scene.

If you disable a World or Active Grid, it will not be picked up and tracked by the Componenet Manager. So if later you 
enable the component and save your persistent data via one of the Component Manager's save methods, that component will not 
have its data saved.

So I repeat,

Only Worlds and Active Grids that will be used as prototypes (via the Component Manager) 
should be disabled.

Also keep in mind that Worlds that don't have an Active Grid synced to them or Active Grid's that aren't synced 
to a World will usually enter an idle state when 
not being used. So don't be too concerned about using an inspector created World and just letting it sit there
for a while.
