I'll be using a zip file to store the source code from now on (previously, a Unity Package was used). You can delete the Unity Package source 
code, as it is not needed.

Do not unzip the source code in a project that contains the Dynamic Loading Kit, as it will cause conflict errors.

If you decide to use the source in another project rather than the DLL's, keep in mind the following:

1) The .cs files in the DynamicLoadingKitEditorsDLLScript folder should be placed in a folder called Editor in your project.

2) In addition to the source files, you should add the WorldGrid.cs file to your project 
(found in the TerrainSlicing/OtherScripts/DynamicLoadingScripts folder)

3) You should also copy the following scripts into a folder named Editor:
	a)	DynamicLoadingManagerCreator.cs
	b)	WorldGridEditor.cs

Both files can be found in the TerrainSlicing/OtherScripts/DynamicLoadingScripts/Editor folder.

4) It is recommended to also copy the PlayerMover scripts found in TerrainSlicing/OtherScripts/DynamicLoadingScripts/PlayerMoverControllers,
though this is not required.
