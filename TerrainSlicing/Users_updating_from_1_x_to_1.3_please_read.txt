It is no longer necessary to rename/resave the files to get things working with 4.x users.

All files should work no matter what version of Unity you are using.

However, because I changed the file structure around a bit, it may be necessary to delete some files to remove duplicates.

Delete the folder titled "Editor" and the script titled "SetNeighbors.js", 
which both can be found directly under the "TerrainSlicing" folder. 
Do not delete the other "Editor" folders not found directly the TerrainSlicing folder.

Ex:

TerrainSlicing/EditorTools/Editor <---- DO NOT DELETE
TerrainSlicing/OtherScripts/CustomEditors/Editor <---- DO NOT DELETE

TerrainSlicing/Editor <---- DELETE

------------------------------------------

TerrainSlicing/OtherScripts/Components/SetNeighbors.js <---- DO NOT DELETE

TerrainSlicing/SetNeighbors.js <---- DELETE
