150 (Row 1 Length)
150 (Row 2 Length)
150 (Row 3 Length)

500 (column 1 Width)
182.3 (column 2 Width)

False (Cell_1_1 is not empty)
False (Cell_1_2 is not empty)
False (Cell_2_1 is not empty)
False (Cell_2_2 is not empty)
False (Cell_3_1 is not empty)
False (Cell_3_2 is not empty)

Example of a 3(rows) x 2(columns) 2D world (XZ vs XY axis doesn't matter here). False indicates a grid is NOT EMPTY. DO NOT include the stuff in ()'s. 
DO include the spaces between the data types.

Note the number of falses = the number of grids = rows * columns.

If all values for a given data type (row lengths, for example) are the same, you can compress the lines to a single line with the value. Ex:

The above lines of data can be compressed to this:
150 (compressed)

500
182.3

False (compressed)

Again, leave out the ()'s and make sure a space separates each data type.
